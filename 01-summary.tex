\cvsection{PROFILE}

\cvtext{I’m a passionate software developer that have been working with Python for more than 10 years doing consulting, research, web development, data cleasing, data scraping, cloud programming, testing, etc. I’ve worked also managing small software developer teams and onboarding new developers. I really love programming and I’m seeking a position that would allow me to build data products to help people improve their lifes. I’ve got a master degree on Computer Science focused on Clustering Algorithms in 2012 and want to return to this field of knowledge to improve my skills as a data engineer. Maybe find a new subject for a doctorate program. I am eager about promoting the use of Python in the local community of developers, mainly Python groups. I've helped organize Python Brasil 2014 Conference. Also I am one of the brazilians ambassadors for the Scipy Latin America community. }
