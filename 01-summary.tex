\cvsection{PROFILE}

\cvtext{I am a passionate software developer who has been working with Python since 2010. I have experience in web development, computational intelligence algorithms, data scraping, cloud computing, testing, and various other skill sets. Throughout my career, I had the chance to manage and onboard small software development teams. I have a passion for programming and I am seeking a position that would allow me to build data products that help people improve their lives. The position I held the most in my career was backend engineer. Additionally, I have improved my frontend skills and worked as a full-stack engineer for the last couple of years. Besides that, I have a good familiarity with statistics and math. I received my masters in computer science in 2012. My thesis topic was clustering algorithms using symbolic data. Lastly, I am eager to promote the Science and programming in the Brazilian developer's community, mainly in Python groups. I helped organize Python Brasil 2014 and Scipy Latina America 2021 conferences.}
