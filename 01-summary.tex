\cvsection{PROFILE}

\cvtext{I am a passionate software developer that has been working with Python for more than 10 years. I have extensive experience in consulting, research, web development, data cleansing, data scraping, cloud programming, testing, and a variety of other skill sets. I have also managed small software developer teams and the onboarding of new developers. I have a passion for programming and I am seeking a position that would allow me to build data products that help people  improve their lives. I received my Masters in Computer Science, specializing on Clustering Algorithms in 2012, and I want to return to this field to improve my skills as a data engineer, potentially transitioning into a future doctoratal program. I am eager to promote the use of Python in the Brazilian developers community, mainly Python groups. I helped organize the Python Brasil 2014 Conference and I am one of the Brazilian Ambassadors for the Scipy Latin America community.}
