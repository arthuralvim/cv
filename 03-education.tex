{Specialization in Deep Learning}
{Universidade Federal de Pernambuco}
{Deep Learning is an important field of A.I. based on a set of innovative ways to interpret data at various levels of abstraction aiming to solve perception problems, detect concepts in data, translate or understand different data languages, etc. Being one of the most promising approaches in academia or industry, the use of DL has been applied by large companies in the world as a basis for innovation and competitive advantage over their competitors. I'm looking forward to finishing this specialization since a qualified professional in DL has been highly demanded in the market.}
