{Master of Science in Computer Science}
{Universidade Federal de Pernambuco}
{My thesis focused on weighted clustering methods for symbolic interval data. I was mentored by Renata Maria Cardoso de Souza, Ph.D. who helped me to be selected for a scholarship (Fundação de Amparo à Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco, FACEPE). I implement various clustering algorithms for symbolic interval data and compared their performance against mine for certain scenarios. I used Matlab, Python, and R as programming languages to support me in the experiments.}
