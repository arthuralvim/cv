    {Widevis Tecnologia em Des. de Software LTDA}
    {On completion of my masters I started a company called Widevis. It was selected for a pre-incubation program of Porto Digital. We had access to classes on entrepreneurship and consulting specialized in technology businesses. Our goal was to develop a social network to raise money for Brazilian soccer teams in exchange for using their stadiums, players interactions, a marketplace and budget transparency. Unfortunately, we didn’t go to the incubation step and as a result closed the company.}
